This is a version of Ben Eater's SAP computer built in the Digital tool.

Digital is a digital circuit designer/simulator that allows you to build and simulate pretty much any digital circuit (think Logisim with active development).

Digital is designed and built by a professor who uses it for teaching his students.

The developer is very responsive to requests and bug reports (I, personally, have made many).
